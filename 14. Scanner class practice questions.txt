Here are some practice questions related to using the Scanner class in Java:

1. Write a Java program that takes two integer inputs from the user and prints their sum.

2. Develop a program that reads a user's name as a string and their age as an integer, 
   and then displays a message including both the name and age.

3. Create a program that reads a floating-point number from the user and 
   calculates its square root using the Math.sqrt() function. Display the result.

4. Write a Java program that reads a sentence from the user and counts the number 
  of words in it. Assume that words are separated by spaces.

5. Develop a program that takes a user input in degrees Celsius and converts it to 
  Fahrenheit using the formula F = C * 9/5 + 32. Display the converted temperature.

6. Implement a program that prompts the user to enter three words and then prints 
   them in reverse order.

7. Create a program that reads an integer from the user and checks whether it's 
   an even or odd number. Display an appropriate message.

8. Write a Java program that reads a line of text from the user and converts it 
  to uppercase using the toUpperCase() method. Display the uppercase text.

9. Develop a program that takes two double inputs, representing the base and height of 
   a triangle, and calculates its area using the formula area = 0.5 * base * height.
   Display the calculated area.

10. Implement a program that reads a string from the user and checks if it's a palindrome 
   (reads the same backward as forward). Display whether it's a palindrome or not.

Remember to import the java.util.Scanner class at the beginning of your programs before using it.
